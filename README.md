Keras tuner is one of the easiest ways of hyperparameter tuning. This code serves as a reference how to use it to create "hypermodels". Hypermodels are models which do not have a fixed amount of layers defined at the beginning of training. The amount of layers is also optimized during hyperparameter tuning.
